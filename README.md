# Face
# 🧠 Advanced Face Detection System

A powerful and real-time face detection project using OpenCV and Deep Learning models, aimed at delivering high accuracy even in challenging environments such as poor lighting, multiple faces, occlusions, and varied angles.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built to detect faces in real-time from camera feeds, videos, or images using state-of-the-art face detection models. It includes:

- Real-time video feed face detection
- Accurate detection using Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
- Support for image and video input
- GUI integration with Python (Tkinter / PyQt optional)
- Easy to use, scalable, and modular codebase

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- OpenCV
- Dlib / Haar Cascades / DNN (Caffe / SSD / YOLO)
- NumPy
- (Optional) Tkinter for GUI
- (Optional) Flask for web-based access

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection using webcam
- ✅ Face detection from images and video files
- ✅ Highly accurate DNN-based face detection (Caffe or YOLO)
- ✅ Frame-by-frame face tracking with bounding boxes
- ✅ GUI or CLI-based interface
